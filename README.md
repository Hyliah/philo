<h2>♦ Dining Philosophers problem ♦</h2>
<p> 
This problem, first formulated by Edsger Dijkstra, involves a group of philosophers who need to eat and think, but must share forks to eat <br>
<p align="center"> ♦♦♦ </p>
Imagine five philosophers sitting around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti and five forks, one between each pair of philosophers. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. To eat, a philosopher needs to pick up both the fork to their left and the fork to their right.
